Mobile optimization: Enhanced UX for phone users

📱 Mobile-First Design Improvements:
- Redesigned with mobile-first approach (smaller base spacing)
- Enhanced touch targets (min 44-48px for all buttons)
- Improved typography scaling for small screens
- Optimized navigation for thumb-friendly interaction

🎨 Visual Enhancements:
- Reduced padding/margins for mobile screens
- Better contrast and readability on small displays
- Smoother animations optimized for mobile performance
- Grid layouts that work better on narrow screens

⚡ Performance Optimizations:
- Faster transitions for mobile (0.2s vs 0.3s)
- Passive touch event listeners
- Optimized image loading and rendering
- Better memory management for low-end devices

🔧 Technical Improvements:
- Added proper viewport meta tags
- iOS Safari specific optimizations
- Touch callout and highlight prevention
- Safe area support for newer iPhones
- Dark mode media query support

📏 Responsive Breakpoints:
- Mobile-first: < 768px (optimized base experience)
- Tablet: 768px - 1024px (enhanced layout)
- Desktop: > 1025px (full desktop experience)

🎯 UX Enhancements:
- Larger, easier-to-tap buttons
- Better spacing between interactive elements
- Improved share button layout (2x2 grid on mobile)
- Enhanced loading states and feedback
- Smoother AI content expand/collapse

✅ Cross-Device Testing:
- iPhone/Android optimized
- Landscape/portrait orientation support
- Various screen sizes (320px - 428px width)
- Touch vs hover device detection
